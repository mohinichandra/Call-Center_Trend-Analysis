# Call-Center_Trend-Analysis

This Power BI project aims to analyze a comprehensive call center dataset with features including Call ID, Agent, Date, Time, Topic, Answered (Y/N), Resolved, Speed of Answer (seconds), Avg Talk Duration, and Satisfaction Rating. The goal is to gain valuable insights into call center performance, customer satisfaction, and emerging trends.

Key Dataset Features:

Call ID: Unique identifier for each call.
Agent: Information about the handling agent.
Date and Time: Timestamps for each call.
Topic: Categorization of calls based on the conversation subject.
Answered (Y/N): Indicates if the call was answered.
Resolved: Indicates if the call was successfully resolved.
Speed of Answer: Time is taken for a call to be answered.
Avg Talk Duration: Average duration of each call.
Satisfaction Rating: Customer feedback on satisfaction.
Using Power BI's extensive range of visualizations and analytical capabilities, we will create dynamic reports and dashboards to explore the dataset and uncover key call center trends and insights. 

The analysis will include:

Call Volume and Distribution: Analyzing the number of calls received over time, identifying peak hours or days, and examining the distribution of calls across different topics.

Call Center Performance: Evaluating metrics such as speed of answer, average talk duration, and resolution rates to assess call center efficiency and identify opportunities for improvement.

Customer Satisfaction Analysis: Examining satisfaction ratings to understand customer perceptions and identify factors influencing customer satisfaction levels.

Trend Identification: Identifying emerging trends or recurring issues based on call topics, allowing proactive measures to address customer concerns or improve service delivery.

Power BI's interactive visualizations will enable drill-down analysis and the ability to slice and dice the data based on various dimensions such as date, topic, agent, and satisfaction rating. This will empower call center managers and stakeholders to make data-driven decisions, optimize operations, and enhance customer service.
